# Chat-Server-and-Client-using-Socket-Programming-PYTHON-
This project is based on the socket programming in the pythhon programming language which is used for low level connection.
The project is performed by using the select module for multiClient support to the server.
As of the single Server client talk does not require the select module.
The core work of the multiple client is supported by the select module itself..

Hope the first project is compatible at all type of OS....
